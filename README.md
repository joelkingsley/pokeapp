# PokeApp

PokeApp is a sample app that I designed and developed from scratch as part of my iOS Development learning. It uses a Pokedex API to fetch details of the first 150 Pokemons and allows each user to create teams with them. It uses 100% programmatic UI with UIKit (without Storyboard), Coordinator Pattern for the app's navigation, and repository pattern for the domain layer.
